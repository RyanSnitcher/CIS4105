Why is version / source control important?
- Version\source control is important because it allows for developers and users to see exactly what kind of modifications have been made to the software. When that code modification history is available to, say, an individual or a team, they can see what kinds of commits(making a change, or changes) were made prior. Without that reference point, it would be a hassle to see where they may have been progression or regression. Also, not having version control wouldn't allow you to use features such as branching and tagging to help make even more updates. To have such an extensive reference point will help a solo or group of developers go a long way.

well done!
